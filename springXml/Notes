*********This is on Spring xml configuration with Lombok***********
	####

--> Application Context create which create spring cointainer
--> DI using getter-setter // constructor with ref object  // inner beans rather than ref // List of Beans
--> rather than ref use autowire in bean tag
--> ApplicationContextAware and BeanNameAware
--> Bean Inheritance so child inherits parent bean. Use abstract true if not parent bean will be initialised. Use InitializingBean, disposibleBean
--> Lifecycle callback = use AbstractApplicationContext to registerHook. Used for desktop application as we need to specify 
--> another way to configure lifecycle is using  init-method and destroy-method. We can use it bean tags of particular bean else for all Beans in Beans tag
--> BeanPostProcessor Before and After init is called at first. The main bean is called then. after this the Bean Name Aware is called.
--> BeanFactoryPostProcessor is used to change anything in beanfactory default method.
--> PropertyPlaceHolder is configured to get value from properties file check spring.xml



###Life cycle of spring 

BeanFactoryPostProcessor  -->  BeanPostProcessor  --> BeanNameAware   --> ApplicationContextAware  --> InitializingBean  -->  init-method (spring.xml)

If ApplicationCOntextAware is used the it is closed using registerShutdownHook()

DisposableBean  --> destroy-method
